# TDD Adventures

Welcome to TDD Adventures, the first (and possibly only) adventure in a series. The purpose of TDD Adventures is to help you
become accustomed to TDD with Ruby and RSpec, in a fun and interesting way. We have written all the tests for you, it is your job to make them past.


## How it works
Simple clone this repo and run

  bundle install

Then run the `rspec` command. All the instructions you need will be provided, but just so you know what to expect, it works like this

* run `rspec`
* tests all fail
* write code to make the tests pass
* run `rspec` again
* tests pass
* refactor!
* `get merge` the next challenge (instructions will be provided)
* eat, sleep, code, repeat
