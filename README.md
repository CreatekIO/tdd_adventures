# TDD Adventures

Welcome to TDD Adventures, the first (and possibly only) adventure in a series. The purpose of TDD Adventures is to help you
become accustomed to TDD with Ruby and RSpec, in a fun and interesting way. We have written all the tests for you, it is your job to make them past.


## How it works
Clone the repo and run bundle link so
```bash
git clone git@github.com:CreatekIO/tdd_adventures.git
cd tdd_adventures
bundle install
```
    
RSpec will guild you the rest of the way, simple run ```rpsec``` and follow the instructions, but as a guide, the flow is like this: 

* run `rspec`
* tests all fail
* write code to make the tests pass
* run `rspec` again
* tests all pass
* refactor!
* `get merge` the next challenge (instructions provided by ```rspec```)
* eat, sleep, code, repeat
